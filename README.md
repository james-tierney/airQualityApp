# airQualityApp
A simple Tkinter GUI that using API Requests based off of US zip codes to retrieve data related to air quality 
built with python 3 uses an api to request information related to the specific zipcode provided in the text box then retrieves that information in json format,
and depending on what boundries the air quality meets the gui will change to the corresponding colour of those boundries.
